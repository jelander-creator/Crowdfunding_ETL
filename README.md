# Crowdfunding_ETL
The final code for this project is under the file name ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_JElander_final_1.ipynb. Please note that I used the AI learning tool and Stack Exchange for resources on this project.
To run the code please open a terminal and begin running Jupyter Notebook. Then open the notebook file containing the final code(ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_JElander_final_1.ipynb) and run each cell in order.
To export the final CSV files you should run the code in order and category.csv and subcategory.csv should be exported automatically to the resources directory. the cleaned campaign.csv and contacts.csv should be saved there as well.
